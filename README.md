## 🛠️ Tools I Use

| Tool | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Bolt.new** | Full-stack app generation | Quick MVPs, visual development |
| **v0** | UI component generation | Clean React code, design systems |
| **Claude** | Debugging & prompt crafting | Fixing bugs, writing better prompts |
| **Cursor** | AI code editor | Advanced development work |
| **Vercel** | Deployment | Hosting and continuous deployment |

## 🚀 Quick Start Guides

### Using This Repo

1. **Browse by series** - Each folder contains code from specific videos
2. **Copy prompts** - Use the `/prompts/` directory for ready-to-use AI prompts
3. **Run examples** - Follow README instructions in each project folder
4. **Learn and modify** - All code is meant to be experimented with

### My Typical Workflow

```
1. Design Concept → Figma/sketches
2. Prompt Crafting → Use Claude to write detailed prompts
3. Generation → Feed to Bolt.new or v0
4. Debugging → Use Claude to fix issues
5. Deployment → Push to Vercel
```
