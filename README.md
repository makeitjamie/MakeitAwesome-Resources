# Make It Awesome 🚀

Resources, prompts, and project links from the **Make It Awesome** YouTube channel - where product designers learn to build with AI.

## 📺 About This Channel

As a product designer and design manager, I'm exploring how AI tools empower designers to build functional products. This repository is the central hub for all tutorials, resources, and links to project repos featured on the channel.

**My approach:** Show the *real* process - including bugs, iterations, and debugging. No BS, just practical workflows.

   └─> Generate initial version
   └─> 2-3 iterations max

4. Debugging (Claude)
   └─> Paste errors, get fixes
   └─> Understand WHY bugs happened

5. Deploy (Vercel)
   └─> One-click deployment
   └─> Test live version

6. Share & Iterate
   └─> GitHub repo
   └─> YouTube tutorial
   └─> Community feedback
```
